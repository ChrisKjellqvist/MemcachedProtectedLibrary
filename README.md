# Threadcached
Threadcache is a high performance user-space, shared, key/value cache
store. It is a modification of upstream memcached using work from
Mohammad Hedayati(Hodor) & Wentao Cai(RPMalloc).

This work is an example to show that these technologies can accelerate
and benefit a system. I have removed a lot of advanced functionality
from memcached do make this doable as a student project. However, the
core functionality as a LRU cache is still there.
